feat: Implement dynamic descriptions and KPI dashboard

This commit introduces two main features and several improvements:

**Features:**

1.  **Dynamic Budget Descriptions:**
    *   Adds template fields to the `ProdutoTemplate` and `ProdutoConfiguracao` models.
    *   Allows creating formatted descriptions for budget items and configurations using attribute and component variables (e.g., `{{ altura }}`, `{{ componentes.fechadura }}`).
    *   The rendering logic is applied to both the Excel export and the web interface for consistent presentation.

2.  **Consumption KPI Dashboard:**
    *   Creates a new dashboard page at `/consumos/relatorios/kpis/`.
    *   Implements an API endpoint for consumption details per project (`obra`).
    *   Displays the following KPIs:
        *   Total Production Time.
        *   Tables for Production Time by Workstation and by Operator.
        *   Table for Average Time per Operation.
        *   An interactive section to view detailed material consumption per project, with a dropdown for selection.

**Fixes & Refactoring:**

*   Fixes the normalization of template variable names to handle accents and special characters.
*   Refactors the `editar_orcamento` view and the Excel export to support the new description and hierarchical numbering logic.
*   Improves UI consistency by moving the dashboard link to the reports section.
*   Resolves various `IndentationError` and `TemplateSyntaxError` issues that arose during development.
