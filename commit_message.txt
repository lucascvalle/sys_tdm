feat: Comprehensive System Overhaul - Budgeting Components & Consumption Tracking

This commit introduces a major overhaul of the system, integrating advanced budgeting component management and a new consumption tracking module.

Key Enhancements:

Budgeting System (as per 0.1.1.txt and 0.1.2.txt):
- Implemented a flexible Product Configuration architecture, allowing multiple component and finish variations for base product templates.
- Enhanced item addition flow: Category -> Template -> Configuration -> Attributes.
- Developed a "Configuration Manager" for creating/editing product configurations, including component selection and quantity definition.
- Introduced a "Margin Manager" to define item unit prices based on raw material, component, finish, labor, and assembly costs.
- Updated Excel export for budgets to reflect the new product configuration hierarchy and production sheet generation.
- Refactored product models to support Component, ProductConfiguration, and InstanceComponent relationships.

Consumption Tracking System:
- Added a new "Consumos" (Consumption) application to manage material consumption and work sessions.
- Implemented models for Work Sessions (SessaoTrabalho), Workstations (PostoTrabalho), Operators (Operador), and Material Consumption Records (ItemConsumido).
- Developed views and templates for CRUD operations on consumption data.
- Integrated reporting functionalities for Material Consumption and Machine Utilization.
- Enabled Excel export for consumption reports, including detailed descriptions for consumed items.
- Improved UI for the consumption home page, separating management and reporting sections.

General Improvements:
- Updated `.gitignore` to properly exclude development artifacts and temporary files, ensuring a cleaner repository.
- Refactored `__str__` methods in several models for better representation and error handling.

This release significantly expands the system's capabilities, moving towards a more comprehensive management solution for production and resource tracking.
