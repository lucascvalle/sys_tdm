docs: Document models and fix Excel export errors

This commit focuses on improving code documentation and correcting existing issues:

- Added module-level docstring to `sys_tdm/sys_tdm/produtos/models.py` for better code clarity and maintainability.
- Corrected indentation errors, removed duplicate lines, and fixed a syntax error in `sys_tdm/sys_tdm/orcamentos/excel_utils.py`.
- Other minor adjustments across `consumos`, `estoque`, `orcamentos`, and `produtos` applications, including:
    - Adding docstrings to forms and admin files.
    - Updating URLs and templates.
    - Refactoring some views for clarity.
